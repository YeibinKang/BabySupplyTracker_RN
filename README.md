# BabySupplyTracker_RN
> A React Native version of the Baby Supply Tracker app for parents/caregivers.


## Project Introduction
As a parent who knows firsthand the chaos of keeping track of baby supplies, I'm on a mission to create a game-changing mobile app that makes parents' lives a little easier.ðŸš€

## Target User
A new parent, a seasoned pro, or somewhere in between!

## Result of user survey
Between March 24 and April 2, 2025, I conducted a survey involving 44 caregivers in Canada and South Korea to better understand their needs and behaviors.

Key findings include:
- 52% of caregivers shop for baby supplies at least once a week.
- 75% either donâ€™t track supplies or rely on memory.
- **Importantly, 75% of respondents said they would likely use the app once it becomes available.**

## Main features
* Basic inventory management (View, Add, Update, Delete items)
* Colored-coded cards for quick status check (accessible for colorblind user)
* Filter by category and inventory status
* Guest mode: No login required, local-only inventory
* Logged-in mode: Requires login, enables inventory sharing between users
* Connection with Google Shopping Link for low stock items

## Product Design Insights
- **Minimal Input Flow**: Reduced required fields to accommodate busy parents.
- **Guest Mode**: Survey data showed many parents donâ€™t need sharing â€” login is optional.
- **Optional Details**: Users can choose to input more details via toggles.
- **Accessibility**: Colorblind-friendly status indicators for low stock and expiry.
- **Clear Filters**: Easy-to-use filtering with visual feedback and reset option.
