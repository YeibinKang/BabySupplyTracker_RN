# BabySupplyTracker_RN
> A React Native version of the Baby Supply Tracker app for parents/caregivers.


## Project Introduction
As a parent who knows firsthand the chaos of keeping track of baby supplies, I'm on a mission to create a game-changing mobile app that makes parents' lives a little easier.ðŸš€

## Target User
A new parent, a seasoned pro, or somewhere in between!

## Result of user survey
> Between March 24 and April 2, 2025, I conducted a survey involving 44 caregivers from Canada and South Korea to better understand their needs and behaviors.
